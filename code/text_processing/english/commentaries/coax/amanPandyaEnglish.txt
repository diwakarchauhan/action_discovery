1		26		two triangles are in a box
27		45		there is an open box
46		67		their tips are touching and 
68		83		the triangles  are rotating
84		107		with respect to each other
108		164		now they are separated and the bigger triangle moves out of the box
165		205		it is sort of waiting for the smaller triangle to come out
206		216		but it is not coming out
217		247		the smaller triangle seems very reluctant to come out
248		283		it is not even letting the bigger triangle to move out of the box
284		356		the bigger triangle now seems to be pushing the smaller triangle out of the box
357		383		and it is waiting for him to go ahead
384		409		but is very reluctant to not moving out
410		465		now very forcefully the bigger triangle seems to have 
466		484		pushed the smaller triangle out
485		527		and the smaller triangle is roaming around the region
528		558		the bigger triangle seems to be happy
559		585		they are connected to each other
