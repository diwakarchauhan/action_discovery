24		71		this structure has a bigger rectangle and a smaller rectangle
72		91		which has two triangles enclosed
92		133		one side of the rectangle has a sort of an opening
134		186		the two triangles seem to be dancing and chasing each other
187		203		
204		229		they seem to be rotating in funny ways
230		263		
264		292		seem like they are playing some sort of game
294		340		
341		373		so here the bigger triangle is pushing the smaller one 
374		384		
385		401		out of the rectangle
402		428		
429		471		the smaller triangle seems to be trying to move on for some reason
472		503		
504		529		and it is exploring the bigger rectangle
530		561		
562		598		and then larger rectangle
599		619		dances around them
