now they are separated and the bigger triangle moves out of the box the bigger triangle is now outside the box and the smaller triangle is still inside and now one of the bigger triangle has gone outside the two triangles seem to be dancing and chasing each other so now the bigger one comes out the bigger triangle goes out  now the bigger one has gone outside  the smaller triangle is moving around and the big triangle is going outside the box and they are attached by vertex and the red triangle is outside the red object tries to 		
the triangles  are rotating with respect to each other there is an inner square and an outer square and both of them are trying to align themselves to their vertices which has two triangles enclosed two triangles one small and one big are playing in an arena both are playing with each other inside the box  now the triangles are touching each other and rotating and they both want to remain in the box both are fighting to stay in a big box which is sort of ring 		 it is sort of waiting for the smaller triangle to come out the bigger triangle is out of the inner square now and the smaller triangle is still inside and now one of the bigger triangle has gone outside and it is trying to come back in the two triangles seem to be dancing and chasing each other  so now the bigger one comes out   he is inside again and the big triangle is going outside the box the red triangle is outside turn the blue object by moving outside the box 		
now very forcefully the bigger triangle seems to have  the smaller triangle is outside the box and the bigger triangle is still inside the box and gone outside completely the smaller triangle seems to be trying to move on for some reason he is trying to explore the smaller triangle tries to roam around outside the small triangle is now outside   and now the blue object is trying to 		 the bigger triangle seems to be happy  both of the triangles are outside the box and they are playing around and they are again interacting and  now both the triangles stay outside both the triangle are outside the box the red triangle is outside the door and they both are now outside the box  		
 they are in a semi closed box one side of the rectangle has a sort of an opening they are confined within a space  they are roaming the small triangle is roaming around the red one is making the smaller one move in specific ways   and right now there are two triangle inside and they are attached by vertex and  		 it is not even letting the bigger triangle to move out of the box seem like they are playing some sort of game so finally he is trying his best and the still the smaller triangle is inside the box into doing some specific things and the big triangle is trying to pull the small triangle now the small triangle is trying to stretch his one of the vertex but this strategy does not work for him 		
the bigger triangle is trying to push the and then it has again gone out and trying to come back in then it is pushing the smaller one out  but the smaller one does not agree may be go outside the box the small triangle is refusing to move  so he tries to move up  		 and the smaller triangle is roaming around the region  and now the bigger one goes outside  and it is exploring the bigger rectangle area outside the arena and get acquainted with the surroundings over there the smaller one is roaming outside and it is moving around very slowly the blue triangle is outside taunt the red object the small object tries to 		
the smaller triangle is trying to push it outside the box and then it has again gone out and trying to come back in so finally he is trying his best may be go outside the box stretch his one of the vertex so he tries to move up but now basically both are fighting 		 and it is waiting for him to go ahead but is very reluctant to not moving out smaller triangle out of the inner square  and it has pushed the smaller one out the smaller one has again come inside  out of the rectangle so he is trying to push him outside the arena  the small triangle to go outside red triangle is pushing the smaller triangle outside the smaller triangle is of blue color so that it can win  		
their tips are touching and the triangles  are rotating one is small one is slightly bigger and both of them are trying to align themselves to their vertices this structure has a bigger rectangle and a smaller rectangle which has two triangles enclosed both are playing with each other inside the box  there are two triangles inside the box  i can see a rectangle with little two triangles they both are fighting to remain in a box both are fighting to stay in a big box 		 now very forcefully the bigger triangle seems to have pushed the smaller triangle out  now the smaller triangle is outside the smaller triangle is outside the box and the bigger triangle is still inside the box the smaller triangle seems to be trying to move on for some reason  the smaller triangle tries to roam around outside   and now the blue object is trying to  		
and it is waiting for him to go ahead smaller triangle out of the inner square now the bigger triangle is trying to push the smaller triangle outside the box and it has pushed the smaller one out so here the bigger triangle is pushing the smaller one  so he is trying to push him outside the arena and he tries to push the smaller triangle outside again  it is pushing the smaller triangle outside the box  the big triangle is trying to push red triangle is pushing the smaller triangle outside drag out push out the blue object the big object is trying to move out the small object so that it can win 		 they are connected to each other  now their vertices have touched  circling around each other  and then larger rectangle and after exploring they both started playing outside and enjoying   the bigger triangle is focing and big triangle is now interacting with the small triangle and now they both are and they both are fighting so that  		
two triangles are in a box there is an open box there are two triangles and two squares here there are two triangles in the box there are two triangles   we can see two triangles over here there are two triangles the bigger red one the smaller blue one  so there is a red object and there is blue smaller object there is a big object and a small object 		 it is sort of waiting for the smaller triangle to come out but it is not coming out the bigger triangle is out of the inner square now and it is coming again  and it is trying to come back in it comes back in  they seem to be rotating in funny ways and he is trying to call the smaller one out he is inside again which is bigger and of red color turn the blue object by moving outside the box 		
the bigger triangle now seems to be pushing the smaller triangle out of the box the bigger triangle is trying to push the then it is pushing the smaller one out  so here the bigger triangle is pushing the smaller one but the smaller one does not agree and he tries to push the smaller triangle outside again  the small triangle is refusing to move the big triangle is trying to push  drag out push out the blue object the big object is trying to move out the small object 		 and the smaller triangle is roaming around the region the bigger triangle seems to be happy and the bigger triangle is also outside now  both of the triangles are outside the box and now the bigger one goes outside and it is exploring the bigger rectangle and get acquainted with the surroundings over there the smaller one is roaming outside  the blue triangle is outside and they both are now outside the box the small object tries to  		
pushed the smaller triangle out now the smaller triangle is outside and now the smaller one is roaming outside   area outside the arena  it can force the smaller one more easily  and it is moving around very slowly seems like the red triangle is stuck at the door  taunt the red object so that it cannot enter into the big box ring basically 		
the smaller triangle seems very reluctant to come out  and out again the bigger triangle now came inside and it attaches to another vertex  smaller one is refusing to do so  it is trying to corner the smaller one   now it is again inside so that the blue object follows him and comes out of the box 		 they are connected to each other and they are playing around  and they are again interacting and circling around each other  and then larger rectangle now both the triangles stay outside both the triangle are outside the box  the red triangle is outside the door  both are fighting 		
but is very reluctant to not moving out  the smaller one has again come inside  out of the rectangle  and now the smaller one comes out and from their tips the small triangle to go outside  the smaller triangle is of blue color using the virtue of his size  		
with respect to each other there is an inner square and an outer square both of them are trying to push each other they are in a semi closed box one side of the rectangle has a sort of an opening two triangles one small and one big are playing in an arena they are confined within a space now  they are roaming the red one is making the smaller one move in specific ways the triangles are touching each other and rotating and right now there are two triangle inside and they both want to remain in the box which is sort of ring 		 it is not even letting the bigger triangle to move out of the box and out again  and it attaches to another vertex  seem like they are playing some sort of game  into doing some specific things now the small triangle is trying to but this strategy does not work for him 		
the smaller triangle seems very reluctant to come out and it is coming again  the bigger triangle now came inside it comes back in they seem to be rotating in funny ways and he is trying to call the smaller one out smaller one is refusing to do so and tries to pull the smaller triangle outside  which is bigger and of red color now it is again inside so that the blue object follows him the big object moves out so that the small object follows it and comes out of the box 		 and it has pushed it outside  and gone outside completely  and now the smaller one comes out he is trying to explore and he gets success in pushing him out and from their tips    using the virtue of his size  the big object blocks the small object 		
there is an open box their tips are touching and there are two triangles and two squares here one is small one is slightly bigger  here we can see that we can see two triangles over here the bigger red one the smaller blue one  there are two triangles inside the box i can see a rectangle with little two triangles so there is a red object and there is blue smaller object they both are fighting to remain in a box there is a big object and a small object both are fighting to stay in a big box 		 now they are separated and the bigger triangle moves out of the box the side of the inner square is cut the bigger triangle is now outside the box the small triangle is roaming around  the smaller triangle is moving around and they are attached by vertex and the red object tries to and this is a game which they are playing
