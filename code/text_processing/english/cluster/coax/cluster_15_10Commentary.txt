it is sort of waiting for the smaller triangle to come out but it is not coming out the smaller triangle seems very reluctant to come out the bigger triangle is out of the inner square now and it is coming again  and the smaller triangle is still inside  the bigger triangle now came inside and it is trying to come back in it comes back in  they seem to be rotating in funny ways  and he is trying to call the smaller one out smaller one is refusing to do so and tries to pull the smaller triangle outside   he is inside again it is trying to corner the smaller one and the big triangle is going outside the box  the red triangle is outside which is bigger and of red color now it is again inside turn the blue object by moving outside the box so that the blue object follows him the big object moves out so that the small object follows it and comes out of the box 		
now they are separated and the bigger triangle moves out of the box it is sort of waiting for the smaller triangle to come out the side of the inner square is cut the bigger triangle is out of the inner square now the bigger triangle is now outside the box and the smaller triangle is still inside and now one of the bigger triangle has gone outside the two triangles seem to be dancing and chasing each other so now the bigger one comes out the small triangle is roaming around the bigger triangle goes out   now the bigger one has gone outside  the smaller triangle is moving around and the big triangle is going outside the box and they are attached by vertex and the red triangle is outside the red object tries to and this is a game which they are playing 		
and the smaller triangle is roaming around the region the bigger triangle seems to be happy they are connected to each other  and the bigger triangle is also outside now  now their vertices have touched both of the triangles are outside the box and they are playing around  and now the bigger one goes outside and they are again interacting and circling around each other and it is exploring the bigger rectangle  and then larger rectangle and after exploring they both started playing outside and enjoying and get acquainted with the surroundings over there now both the triangles stay outside  the smaller one is roaming outside  both the triangle are outside the box  the bigger triangle is focing and big triangle is now interacting with the small triangle the blue triangle is outside the red triangle is outside the door and now they both are and they both are now outside the box and they both are fighting so that the small object tries to  both are fighting  		
and it is waiting for him to go ahead but is very reluctant to not moving out smaller triangle out of the inner square now the bigger triangle is trying to push the smaller triangle outside the box  and it has pushed the smaller one out so here the bigger triangle is pushing the smaller one  out of the rectangle so he is trying to push him outside the arena  it is pushing the smaller triangle outside the box  the small triangle to go outside red triangle is pushing the smaller triangle outside the smaller triangle is of blue color drag out push out the blue object so that it can win 		

but is very reluctant to not moving out now very forcefully the bigger triangle seems to have and it has pushed it outside  the smaller triangle is outside the box and the bigger triangle is still inside the box the smaller one has again come inside  and gone outside completely out of the rectangle  and now the smaller one comes out he is trying to explore and he gets success in pushing him out and from their tips  the small triangle to go outside  the small triangle is now outside the smaller triangle is of blue color  using the virtue of his size   the big object blocks the small object 		 now very forcefully the bigger triangle seems to have pushed the smaller triangle out and the smaller triangle is roaming around the region  now the smaller triangle is outside the smaller triangle is outside the box and the bigger triangle is still inside the box  and now the smaller one is roaming outside the smaller triangle seems to be trying to move on for some reason   area outside the arena the smaller triangle tries to roam around outside  it can force the smaller one more easily the smaller one is roaming outside  and it is moving around very slowly seems like the red triangle is stuck at the door and now the blue object is trying to  taunt the red object so that it cannot enter into the big box ring basically the small object tries to
