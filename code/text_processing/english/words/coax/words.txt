two
triangles
are
in
a
box
there
is
an
open
box
their
tips
are
touching
and
the
triangles
are
rotating
with
respect
to
each
other
now
they
are
separated
and
the
bigger
triangle
moves
out
of
the
box
it
is
sort
of
waiting
for
the
smaller
triangle
to
come
out
but
it
is
not
coming
out
the
smaller
triangle
seems
very
reluctant
to
come
out
it
is
not
even
letting
the
bigger
triangle
to
move
out
of
the
box
the
bigger
triangle
now
seems
to
be
pushing
the
smaller
triangle
out
of
the
box
and
it
is
waiting
for
him
to
go
ahead
but
is
very
reluctant
to
not
moving
out
now
very
forcefully
the
bigger
triangle
seems
to
have
pushed
the
smaller
triangle
out
and
the
smaller
triangle
is
roaming
around
the
region
the
bigger
triangle
seems
to
be
happy
they
are
connected
to
each
other
there
are
two
triangles
and
two
squares
here
there
is
an
inner
square
and
an
outer
square
the
side
of
the
inner
square
is
cut
the
bigger
triangle
is
out
of
the
inner
square
now
and
it
is
coming
again
and
out
again
the
bigger
triangle
is
trying
to
push
the
smaller
triangle
out
of
the
inner
square
and
it
has
pushed
it
outside
now
the
smaller
triangle
is
outside
and
the
bigger
triangle
is
also
outside
now
now
their
vertices
have
touched
there
are
two
triangles
in
the
box
one
is
small
one
is
slightly
bigger
both
of
them
are
trying
to
push
each
other
the
bigger
triangle
is
now
outside
the
box
and
the
smaller
triangle
is
still
inside
the
bigger
triangle
now
came
inside
the
smaller
triangle
is
trying
to
push
it
outside
the
box
now
the
bigger
triangle
is
trying
to
push
the
smaller
triangle
outside
the
box
the
smaller
triangle
is
outside
the
box
and
the
bigger
triangle
is
still
inside
the
box
both
of
the
triangles
are
outside
the
box
and
they
are
playing
around
there
are
two
triangles
and
both
of
them
are
trying
to
align
themselves
to
their
vertices
they
are
in
a
semi
closed
box
and
now
one
of
the
bigger
triangle
has
gone
outside
and
it
is
trying
to
come
back
in
it
comes
back
in
and
it
attaches
to
another
vertex
and
then
it
has
again
gone
out
and
trying
to
come
back
in
then
it
is
pushing
the
smaller
one
out
and
it
has
pushed
the
smaller
one
out
the
smaller
one
has
again
come
inside
and
gone
outside
completely
and
now
the
smaller
one
is
roaming
outside
and
now
the
bigger
one
goes
outside
and
they
are
again
interacting
and
circling
around
each
other
this
structure
has
a
bigger
rectangle
and
a
smaller
rectangle
which
has
two
triangles
enclosed
one
side
of
the
rectangle
has
a
sort
of
an
opening
the
two
triangles
seem
to
be
dancing
and
chasing
each
other
they
seem
to
be
rotating
in
funny
ways
seem
like
they
are
playing
some
sort
of
game
so
here
the
bigger
triangle
is
pushing
the
smaller
one
out
of
the
rectangle
the
smaller
triangle
seems
to
be
trying
to
move
on
for
some
reason
and
it
is
exploring
the
bigger
rectangle
and
then
larger
rectangle
dances
around
them
here
we
can
see
that
two
triangles
one
small
and
one
big
are
playing
in
an
arena
they
are
confined
within
a
space
so
now
the
bigger
one
comes
out
and
he
is
trying
to
call
the
smaller
one
out
smaller
one
is
refusing
to
do
so
so
finally
he
is
trying
his
best
but
the
smaller
one
does
not
agree
so
he
is
trying
to
push
him
outside
the
arena
and
now
the
smaller
one
comes
out
he
is
trying
to
explore
area
outside
the
arena
and
after
exploring
they
both
started
playing
outside
and
enjoying
we
can
see
two
triangles
over
here
both
are
playing
with
each
other
inside
the
box
now
they
are
roaming
the
small
triangle
is
roaming
around
the
bigger
triangle
goes
out
and
tries
to
pull
the
smaller
triangle
outside
and
the
still
the
smaller
triangle
is
inside
the
box
and
he
tries
to
push
the
smaller
triangle
outside
again
and
he
gets
success
in
pushing
him
out
the
smaller
triangle
tries
to
roam
around
outside
and
get
acquainted
with
the
surroundings
over
there
now
both
the
triangles
stay
outside
there
are
two
triangles
the
bigger
red
one
the
smaller
blue
one
the
red
one
is
making
the
smaller
one
move
in
specific
ways
now
the
bigger
one
has
gone
outside
he
is
inside
again
it
is
trying
to
corner
the
smaller
one
into
doing
some
specific
things
may
be
go
outside
the
box
it
is
pushing
the
smaller
triangle
outside
the
box
and
from
their
tips
it
can
force
the
smaller
one
more
easily
the
smaller
one
is
roaming
outside
both
the
triangle
are
outside
the
box
the
bigger
triangle
is
focing
there
are
two
triangles
inside
the
box
the
triangles
are
touching
each
other
and
rotating
the
smaller
triangle
is
moving
around
and
the
big
triangle
is
going
outside
the
box
and
the
big
triangle
is
trying
to
pull
the
small
triangle
the
small
triangle
is
refusing
to
move
the
big
triangle
is
trying
to
push
the
small
triangle
to
go
outside
the
small
triangle
is
now
outside
and
it
is
moving
around
very
slowly
and
big
triangle
is
now
interacting
with
the
small
triangle
and
rotating
outside
i
can
see
a
rectangle
with
little
two
triangles
and
right
now
there
are
two
triangle
inside
and
they
are
attached
by
vertex
and
the
red
triangle
is
outside
which
is
bigger
and
of
red
color
now
it
is
again
inside
now
the
small
triangle
is
trying
to
stretch
his
one
of
the
vertex
red
triangle
is
pushing
the
smaller
triangle
outside
the
smaller
triangle
is
of
blue
color
seems
like
the
red
triangle
is
stuck
at
the
door
the
blue
triangle
is
outside
the
red
triangle
is
outside
the
door
and
now
they
both
are
attached
by
vertex
and
rotating
so
there
is
a
red
object
and
there
is
blue
smaller
object
they
both
are
fighting
to
remain
in
a
box
and
they
both
want
to
remain
in
the
box
the
red
object
tries
to
turn
the
blue
object
by
moving
outside
the
box
so
that
the
blue
object
follows
him
but
this
strategy
does
not
work
for
him
so
he
tries
to
move
up
drag
out
push
out
the
blue
object
using
the
virtue
of
his
size
and
now
the
blue
object
is
trying
to
taunt
the
red
object
and
they
both
are
now
outside
the
box
and
they
both
are
fighting
so
that
the
first
one
can
go
in
the
box
there
is
a
big
object
and
a
small
object
both
are
fighting
to
stay
in
a
big
box
which
is
sort
of
ring
and
this
is
a
game
which
they
are
playing
the
big
object
moves
out
so
that
the
small
object
follows
it
and
comes
out
of
the
box
but
now
basically
both
are
fighting
the
big
object
is
trying
to
move
out
the
small
object
so
that
it
can
win
the
big
object
blocks
the
small
object
so
that
it
cannot
enter
into
the
big
box
ring
basically
the
small
object
tries
to
both
are
fighting
