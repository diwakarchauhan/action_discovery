there
are
two
triangles
and
both
of
them
are
trying
to
align
themselves
to
their
vertices
they
are
in
a
semi
closed
box
and
now
one
of
the
bigger
triangle
has
gone
outside
and
it
is
trying
to
come
back
in
it
comes
back
in
and
it
attaches
to
another
vertex
and
then
it
has
again
gone
out
and
trying
to
come
back
in
then
it
is
pushing
the
smaller
one
out
and
it
has
pushed
the
smaller
one
out
the
smaller
one
has
again
come
inside
and
gone
outside
completely
and
now
the
smaller
one
is
roaming
outside
and
now
the
bigger
one
goes
outside
and
they
are
again
interacting
and
circling
around
each
other
