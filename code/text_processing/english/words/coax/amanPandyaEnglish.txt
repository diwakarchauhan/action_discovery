two
triangles
are
in
a
box
there
is
an
open
box
their
tips
are
touching
and
the
triangles
are
rotating
with
respect
to
each
other
now
they
are
separated
and
the
bigger
triangle
moves
out
of
the
box
it
is
sort
of
waiting
for
the
smaller
triangle
to
come
out
but
it
is
not
coming
out
the
smaller
triangle
seems
very
reluctant
to
come
out
it
is
not
even
letting
the
bigger
triangle
to
move
out
of
the
box
the
bigger
triangle
now
seems
to
be
pushing
the
smaller
triangle
out
of
the
box
and
it
is
waiting
for
him
to
go
ahead
but
is
very
reluctant
to
not
moving
out
now
very
forcefully
the
bigger
triangle
seems
to
have
pushed
the
smaller
triangle
out
and
the
smaller
triangle
is
roaming
around
the
region
the
bigger
triangle
seems
to
be
happy
they
are
connected
to
each
other
