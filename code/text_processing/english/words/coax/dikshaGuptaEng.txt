this
structure
has
a
bigger
rectangle
and
a
smaller
rectangle
which
has
two
triangles
enclosed
one
side
of
the
rectangle
has
a
sort
of
an
opening
the
two
triangles
seem
to
be
dancing
and
chasing
each
other
they
seem
to
be
rotating
in
funny
ways
seem
like
they
are
playing
some
sort
of
game
so
here
the
bigger
triangle
is
pushing
the
smaller
one
out
of
the
rectangle
the
smaller
triangle
seems
to
be
trying
to
move
on
for
some
reason
and
it
is
exploring
the
bigger
rectangle
and
then
larger
rectangle
dances
around
them
