so
there
is
a
red
object
and
there
is
blue
smaller
object
they
both
are
fighting
to
remain
in
a
box
and
they
both
want
to
remain
in
the
box
the
red
object
tries
to
turn
the
blue
object
by
moving
outside
the
box
so
that
the
blue
object
follows
him
but
this
strategy
does
not
work
for
him
so
he
tries
to
move
up
drag
out
push
out
the
blue
object
using
the
virtue
of
his
size
and
now
the
blue
object
is
trying
to
taunt
the
red
object
and
they
both
are
now
outside
the
box
and
they
both
are
fighting
so
that
the
first
one
can
go
in
the
box
