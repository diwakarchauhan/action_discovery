Week 3: (22 Aug- 28 Aug)

Image processing of data :
	0- Read the paper by G Satish(2008)
	1- Identify the two triangles and the frame(if present) in the image;
	in identifying the triangles following methods were tried : 
	    a) if the triangles are seperable by thein projection on x and y axis, then seperate them(this function doesn't give results when the 
	    two triangls are either attached or projection of one triangle overshadows the other one).
	2- Define the boundaries of the shapes and based on that calculate the positions(centroid) of
	each object.
	    a) After seperating the triangles, determine the edges and the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles. To determine the edges,
	    calculate the kmean for the triangle data, this gives three centers forming smaller similar triangle to the original triangle. This
	    result gives the gradient of the edges of the triangle, we can calculate x-axis intecept for all the points and create the 
	    frquency histogram of x-axis intercept. gradients with maximum frequency range will belong to the edge with that gradient.
	    (this gives bad results when the x-axis intercept is fairly large, becaust histograms don't have large frquency)
	3- Get the location of the tip of the smaller triangle.
	4- Wordnet database(find the all the similar verbs for the actions in the videos)
	5- Read hindi word net data and identify the similar verbs as in step 4
